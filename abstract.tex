	These solutions were done as a student who is fresh out of university.
	Now I'm studying the book when doing my mandatory military service.
	
	\vspace{2ex}
	
	The solutions might be brief. However, I state them as clearly as possible I can.
	For the computation part, I might omit details because it is tedious but simple.
	
	\vspace{2ex}
	
	This manual now only contains some selected solutions which I can afford.
	If there is something vague or incredible, it is possible that it doesn't make sense since it is wrong.
	If you have any suggestions or corrections to solutions, please direct to email "chengmao.lee@gmail.com".
	Your intelligence will be highly appreciated.
	
	\vspace{2ex}
	
	Hope this manual could share some constructive ideas or help you that given important hints to solve problems by yourselves, or just verify whether the answers are consistent or not.
	
	\vspace{2ex}
	
	Any way, I hope everybody has good luck and fun in solving problems!
