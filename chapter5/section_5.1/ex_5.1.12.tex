\begin{Exercise}
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item
		\begin{proof}
			Suppose $A$ is similar to $B$, there exists $Q$ which is invertible such that $A = Q^{-1} B Q$. Then consider
			\begin{align*}
			\det(A-\lambda I)
			&= \det(Q^{-1} B Q -\lambda I) \\
			&= \det(Q^{-1} B Q - Q^{-1} \lambda I Q ) \\
			&= \det(Q^{-1} (B-\lambda I) Q ) \\
			&= \det(Q^{-1})\det(B-\lambda I)\det(Q) \\
			&= \det(B-\lambda I).
			\end{align*}
			Hence $A,B$ have the same characteristic polynomial.
		\end{proof}
		
		\item
		\begin{proof}
			Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be arbitrary different bases for $V$, and $T$ be a linear operator on $V$. Since $[T]_{\alpha}$ is similar to $[T]_{\beta}$, from part (a), we know they have the same characteristic polynomial. Because $\alpha$, $\beta$ were arbitrary, this leads to that the statement holds.
