\begin{Exercise}
	\begin{proof}
		$(\Longrightarrow)$
		Suppose $A$ is not a zero matrix. Then $A_{i j}\neq 0$ for some $i,j$, This means $\rank(A)\neq 0$. This argument is equivalent to $\rank(A) = 0$ implies $A$ is a zero matrix.
		
		\vspace{2ex}
		
		$(\Longleftarrow)$
		Since $A$ is a zero matrix, then by definition, $\rank(A) = 0$ trivially.
	\end{proof}
