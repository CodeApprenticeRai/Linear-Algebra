% === Exercise 3.3.10 ===
\begin{Exercise}
	\begin{proof}
		Let $A$ be the coefficient matrix, then the augmented matrix is $A|b$. Since $A|b$ is a $m\times (n+1)$ matrix, we know $\rank(A|b) \leq m$. Notice that $\rank(A|b) \geq \rank(A) = m$. Hence $\rank(A|b) = m$. Moreover, because $\rank(A) = \rank(A|b) = m$, by Theorem 3.11, $Ax = b$ must have at least one solution.
	\end{proof}
