% === Exercise 7.2.6 ===
\begin{Exercise}
	\begin{proof}
		Follow the hint. 
		At first, since $\det(A-\lambda I) = \det(A^t - \lambda I)$, this means $A$ and $A^t$ have the same characteristic polynomial, and hence have the same eigenvalues. 
		We pick arbitrary eigenvalue $\lambda$ of both $A$ and $A^t$, fix it and for any $r\in\mathbb{N}$, we have
		$$
		\rank\big(A-\lambda I\big)^r 
		= \rank\Big(\big(A-\lambda I\big)^t\Big)^r
		= \rank\big(A^t - \lambda I\big)^r.
		$$
		Hence they have the same dot diagram by Theorem 7.9. 
		Then they have the same Jordan canonical form since the Corollary of Theorem 7.10. 
		Moreover, by Theorem 7.11, they are similar.
	\end{proof}
