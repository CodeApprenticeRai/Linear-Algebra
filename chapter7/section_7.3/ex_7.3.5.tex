\begin{Exercise}
	\begin{solution}
		Define $g(t) = t^3-2t^2+t = t(t-1)^2$.
		Since $T$ is diagonalizable, we know the minimal polynomial $p(t)$ could split into distinct linear factors, and $\deg\big(p(t)\big) \leq 2$ 
		There three posibilities:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $p(t) = t$.
			
			In this case, $T = T_0$ trivially.
			
			\item $p(t) = t-1$.
			
			In this case, $T = I$ trivially.
			
			\item $p(t) = t(t-1)$.
			
			In this case, $T$ is similar to $\begin{pmatrix}
			0 & 0 \\
			0 & 1
			\end{pmatrix}$.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{solution}
