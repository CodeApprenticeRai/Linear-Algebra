\begin{answer}
No.
\end{answer}
\begin{proof}
By the Corollary 2(a) of Theorem 1.10, we know any finite generating set for a vector space with dimension $n$ contains at least $n$ vectors.

Notice that the set
$$
\left\{ x^3-2x^2+1,4x^2-x+3,3x-2 \right\}
$$
has only $3$ vectors which is less than $\dim\left(P_3(\mathbb{R})\right) = 4$, then the set cannot generate $P_3(\mathbb{R})$. 
\end{proof}
