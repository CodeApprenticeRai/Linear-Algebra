% === Exercise 1.7.1 ===
\begin{Exercise}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item[(a)]
\begin{answer}
False.
\end{answer}
\begin{solution}
For a counter-example, the family $\{1,2,\cdots,n,\cdots\}$ ordered by $\leq$ has no maximal element.
\end{solution}

\item[(b)]
\begin{answer}
False.
\end{answer}
\begin{solution}
For a counter-example, the chain $\{1,2,\cdots,n,\cdots\}$ ordered by $\leq$ has no maximal element.
\end{solution}

\item[(c)]
\begin{answer}
False.
\end{answer}
\begin{solution}
The family
$$
S = \{ \{a\}, \{b\} \}
$$
is ordered by containment. $S$ has two maximal elements $\{a\}$ and $\{b\}$.
\end{solution}

\item[(d)]
\begin{answer}
True.
\end{answer}
\begin{solution}
Suppose to contrary that there exists at least two distinct maximal elements $A,B$. Since they are in a chain, so by definition, $A\subseteq B$ or $B\subseteq A$ must holds. Moreover, they are maximal, so $A\subseteq B$ and $B\subseteq A$. It follows that $A=B$ contradicts that $A,B$ are distinct.
\end{solution}

\item[(e)]
\begin{answer}
True.
\end{answer}
\begin{solution}
Let $\beta$ be a basis for a vector space $V$. By definition of bases, $\beta$ is linearly independent. Also $span(\beta)=V$, by Theorem 1.7, if $v\in V$ and $v\notin \beta$, then $\beta\cup\{v\}$ is linearly dependent. That is, $\beta$ is a maximal linearly independent subset by definition.
\end{solution}

\item[(f)]
\begin{answer}
True.
\end{answer}
\begin{solution}
It follows from Theorem 1.12.
\end{solution}

\end{enumerate}
