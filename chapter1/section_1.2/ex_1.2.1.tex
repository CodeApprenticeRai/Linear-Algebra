% === Exercise 1.2.1 ===
\begin{Exercise}
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item [(a)]
		\begin{answer}
			True.
		\end{answer}
		\begin{solution}
			This follows from the definition $(VS\ 3)$.
		\end{solution}
		
		\item [(b)]
		\begin{answer}
			False.
		\end{answer}
		\begin{solution}
			This is by corollary 1 of Theorem 1.1. The proof could reference Exercise \ref{ex:1.2.9}.
		\end{solution}
		
		\item [(c)]
		\begin{answer}
			False.
		\end{answer}
		\begin{solution}
			If $x = 0$, then $a$ might not equal to $b$.
		\end{solution}
		
		\item [(d)]
		\begin{answer}
			False.
		\end{answer}
		\begin{solution}
			If $a = 0$, then $x$ might not equal to $y$.
		\end{solution}
		
		\item [(e)]
		\begin{answer}
			True.
		\end{answer}
		\begin{solution}
			This is the definition.
		\end{solution}
		
		\item [(f)]
		\begin{answer}
			False.
		\end{answer}
		\begin{solution}
			It has $m$ rows and $n$ columns.
		\end{solution}
		
		\item [(g)]
		\begin{answer}
			False.
		\end{answer}
		\begin{solution}
			Since $x$ and $x^2$ are members of $P(F)$, then the sum of them is $x^2+x$; however, $x$ has degree $1$ and $x^2$ has degree $2$ which implies $x$ and $x^2$ have different degrees.
		\end{solution}
		
		\item [(h)]
		\begin{answer}
			False.
		\end{answer}
		\begin{solution}
			$x$ and $-x$ are polynomials of degree $1$, but $x+(-x) = 0$ is a polynomial of degree $-1$.
		\end{solution}
		
		\item [(i)]
		\begin{answer}
			True.
		\end{answer}
		\begin{proof}
			Let $f(x) = a_n x^n + \cdots + a_0$ is a polynomial of degree $n$, and $c$ is a nonzero scalar. Notice that $a_n \neq 0$. Consider 
			$$
			cf(x) = c a_n x^n + \cdots + c a_0.
			$$
			Since $c a_n \neq 0$, then $cf(x)$ is also a polynomial of degree $n$ by definition.
		\end{proof}
		
		\item [(j)]
		\begin{answer}
			True.
		\end{answer}
		\begin{solution}
			This is by definition directly.
		\end{solution}
		
		\item [(k)]
		\begin{answer}
			True.
		\end{answer}
		\begin{solution}
			This is the definition.
		\end{solution}
	\end{enumerate}
