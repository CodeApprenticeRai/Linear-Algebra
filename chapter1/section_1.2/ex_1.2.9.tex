\begin{Exercise}\label{ex:1.2.9}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Prove Corollary $1$ of Theorem $1.1$.}
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{proof}
		We have known the zero vector always exists by definition $(VS\ 3)$. Suppose to contrary that a vector space contains more than one zero vector, so at least two zero vectors in this vector space. 
		
		Suppose $x,y$ are arbitrary distinct zero vectors, then by $(VS\ 3)$, we know $x = x+y =y$ which means $x,y$ are identical. This contradicts $x,y$ are distinct.
		
		Hence we conclude the zero vector in a vector space is unique.
	\end{proof}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Prove Corollary $2$ of Theorem $1.1$.}
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{proof}
		We have known for every $x\in V$, there always exists an element $y\in V$ such that $x+y=0$ by definition $(VS\ 4)$. 
		
		Suppose to contrary that at least two distinct elements $y,z$ such that $x+y=0$ and $x+z=0$, then we have $y=z$ which contradicts $y\neq z$ by the supposition.
		
		Hence the element $y$ mentioned from definition $(VS\ 4)$ is unique.
	\end{proof}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Prove Theorem 1.2(c).}
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{proof}
		By definition $(VS\ 1)$, $(VS\ 3)$, $(VS\ 7)$, we know for all $a\in F$,
		$$
		a0 + a0 = a(0+0) = a0 = a0+0 = 0+a0.
		$$
		Hence $a0 = 0$ for all $a\in F$.
	\end{proof}
