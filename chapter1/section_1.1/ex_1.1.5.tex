% === Exercise 1.1.5 ===
\begin{Exercise}
	\begin{proof}
		Since the vector $x = (a_1,a_2)-(0,0) = (a_1,a_2)$, then $t x = t(a_1,a_2) = (t a_1, t a_2)$. Because $(t a_1, t a_2) - (0,0) = (t a_1, t a_2) = t x$, we conclude the vector $t x$ that emanates from the origin terminates at the point with coordinates $(t a_1, t a_2)$.
