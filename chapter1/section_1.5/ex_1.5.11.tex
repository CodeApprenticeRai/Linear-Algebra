\begin{Exercise}
	\begin{answer}
		$2^n$.
	\end{answer}
	\begin{proof}
		Suppose $u_i\in \{0,1\}$ for each $i=1,2,\cdots,n$. Since a set is linearly independent if and only if the only representations of $0$ as linear combinations of its vectors are trivial representations, then for any $v\in span(S)$,
		$$
		v = \sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i u_i = 0
		$$
		is a unique representation. There are $2^n$ representations and hence $\left|span(S)\right| = 2^n$.
	\end{proof}
